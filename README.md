# My Dotfiles
Not the most sophisticated stuff, but it's mine.
Nix flake to keep my changes synced across devices and easy to move to a new install.
Really new to nix, don't copy this if you don't absolutely have to.


### To sync with the repository:
Ensure you have git installed.
Generate hardware configuration in `/etc/nixos` called `hardware.nix`.
Run the bootstrap script.
